# guessing-game
 A terminal based game where the user tries to guess the word from its scrambled letters

 User gets partial points if they make a guess that is grammatically correct (according to the remote spellchecker) and the letters exists in the original letter. They get the full point if their guess is correct, and the game ends. 

 In this project, I wanted to focus on unit testing, and wanted to try to get data from a web source using python beautifulsoup library.
